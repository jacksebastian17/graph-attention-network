# Graph Attention Network (GAT) for Illicit Transaction Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) designed as part of an Undergraduate Research Scholar (URS) thesis at Texas A&M University. The primary aim of this project is to assess the efficacy of the GAT model in predicting illicit transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain in comparison to other binary classification models.

## Data Source

The data utilized for this project originates from the [Elliptic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set). This dataset provides labeled transactional data for illicit and licit Bitcoin transactions, serving as an ideal benchmark for our model.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Download the Elliptic dataset and place the required CSV files in the project directory.
3. Run `gat.py` to train and evaluate the GAT model.
